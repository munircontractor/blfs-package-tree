# BLFS Packages Dependency Tree Builder and Visualizer
This is a python code to plot a the package tree for the Beyond Linux From Scratch books.

The code uses BeautifulSoup from bs4 to scrap the website and generate a list of packages and their dependency tree.  
I am still working on creating the graph for the dependency tree to provide a visual picture of the tree.
